                                                      <p>
                                                          <p>Haven't updated my blog in a while. The past couple of weekends have been pretty hectic.</p>

                                                           <p>During week 5, I did a quick spike to get an understanding of how an HTTP server in Java would work in general. I ended up working off of some example code from a Java socket server tutorial and was able to get a dummy server working fairly quickly. The socket server uses a single protocol object to determine how to handle socket input so my subsequent efforts were spent fleshing out a design for the HTTP protocol.</p>

                                                            <p>TDD came very naturally for me while working on the HTTP server protocol, probably due to my familiarity with Java and JUnit. Progress went quickly on the protocol initially, but I got sidetracked helping Billy manually migrate all of 8th Light's old blog posts to a new format. My initial design stored and manipulated requests as strings but after Doug reviewed the code, he suggested I switch to taking in streams through the sockets instead. With some refactoring, I was able to switch to using streams and it made the rest of my protocol code much better. By the end of the week, I was able to get most of the protocol working with the exception of file handling.</p>

                                                             <p>Uncle Bob gave an impromptu talk for 8LU that Friday. He went over some major issues with the use of the MVC pattern in modern web frameworks and proposed a new pattern that makes use of interactor and record patterns on top of architecture similar to an MVC pattern. The pattern is intended to further increase modularity and allow for better and faster testing. The talk was fairly mind blowing and I would hope to see the pattern used in the development of new frameworks.</p>

                                                              <p>Week 6 was the week of the 4th so we had Monday off. I also planned on being out of town Tuesday and Wednesday so I only came into the office on Thursday and Friday. Thursday I was able to get file handling working on my HTTP server and I also paired with Brian on some front-end javascript for Artisan. I'd been meaning to become more familiar with javascript for a long time and was glad for the opportunity to work with it. I finished the work on Artisan Friday. The eventual plan is for artisan's storyboard to contain everything. Brian added the backlog as a slider to the storyboard and I added some code to allow for some fancy javascript scrolling of the storyboard columns.</p>

                                                               <p>In the beginning of week 7, I figured out how to get cob spec to test a bad http request send to my server and started pairing with Eric Meyer on the Leapfrog and Common Ground projects.</p>

Thankfully, I was able to push a basic working version of the app shortly after lunch.</p>

                                                                                                                                   <p>Following from the Salesforce to Highrise importing tool I wrote last week, Paul got me started with Artisan by fixing and extending the existing AgileZen importer. I found that AgileZen's API had been updated to support JSON as well as XML and made changes in the Artisan importer to reflect that update. I was able to get the Artisan importer to work as it had simply by specifying the XML content-type in the API call. I extended the importer by including 'Completed At' times and including details and comments in the acceptance criteria field. Artisan's existing stories didn't have any data in their 'Completed At' fields so I updated all existing stories with 'Completed At' times corresponding to their iterations' completed times.</p>

                                                                                                                                    <p>By the end of the week, I moved back to working on Tic-Tac-Toe and incoporated Authlogic to begin implementing persistent games. Authlogic was oddly somewhat troublesome to install in Rails 3. There were some issues in the main branch of Authlogic so I had to use a separate fork. </p>

I spent a lot of time staring at an empty Cucumber scenario trying to figure out how to proceed. Eventually I spoke to Li-Hsuan and he suggested a multi-layered testing process by starting with a failing cucumber test followed by a failing rspec test before writing any code. I soon found issues with my gem interface and subsequently went through several redesigns and refactorings of my gem in the implementation of the rails interface.</p>

                                                                                                                                                                                                                   <p>In the middle of the week, Paul pulled me aside and tasked me with writing an importer of Salesforce contact data into Highrise. The Salesforce API proved difficult for me to work with. Designed to be used by other web applications, the Salesforce API required workarounds for authorization within simple desktop apps. I spent some time making attempts at solving the issue until Paul realized he could just export to a csv file. With the csv file, importing and parsing the data was a matter of calling a couple of library methods. My next challenge was to import the data programmatically into Highrise. I initially assumed this step would be trivial because Highrise had a Ruby wrapper for their API. Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out how to create the complex nested contact data hierarchies required for multiple e-mails and phone numbers using the wrapper. I ended up spending a significant amount of time attempting to use several REST libraries of decreasing abstraction to correctly import the contact data. Ultimately, I decided to write the post bodies manually using an xml building library and completed the importer without problems. </p>

I paired with Brian in writing a prime factors app for iOS. We were able to get it done pretty quickly thanks to Brian's experience with Objective-C and my recent practices of the prime factors kata. My initial iOS development impressions are: Xcode 4's interface builder is impressive but Objective-C is a huge pain to work with.</p>

The translation of the minimax algorithm from Python to Ruby was fairly straightforward save for a couple of points. I initially didn't like my Python implementation and looked into cleaning it up. I tried using extra helper classes like minimax node and deltas but the longer I tried using these new classes, my code only grew messier. Ultimately, I scrapped the extra classes and went back to an implementation similar to my original Python version. My Ruby implementation improves on the Python implementation through some decoupling and a few method extractions.</p>

I got around to speccing and implementing the Board class and the entire process seemed to flow well. Things slowed down as I moved to writing the Player and Ai classes due to their reliance on other classes. I'm unfamiliar with the very concepts of mocks and stubs, but with some help from Eric M. I was able to make a few steps in the right direction. Li-Hsuan later explained to me a few key ideas behind mocks and I managed to complete the initial specs and implementations for CpuPlayer and RandomAi.</p>

I plan to gradually update and improve the blogging engine in my spare time alongside writing regular blog entries.</p>

Sinatra seemed to require a bit more configuration for it to do what I needed it to do and I decided I needed more practice with Rails anyway.</p>

I'm still in the process of figuring out how acts_as_taggable handles tag listings (I think I have to build my own).</p>

I'd moved into the city last Saturday and had been slowly getting used to living in the city when Li-Hsuan invited me to meet up with the Pernix guys on Memorial Day. I figured it wouldn't hurt to get an early start for the summer and I ended up pairing with Carlos while we worked on some front-end bugs for a Costa Rican newspaper company's website. Luckily, it just required some basic HTML and JS knowledge and I was happy to be able to help out.</p>

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <p>I had my official start on Tuesday and Doug had me begin by practicing the Prime Factors kata in Ruby. I found the kata incredibly useful in reinforcing TDD concepts and in causing me to realize how weak my TDD abilities are. I also noticed that practicing and performing the kata felt very similar to practicing and performing kata (forms) in martial arts. In both, you learn and practice a movement bit-by-bit until the entire sequence gradually becomes smoother. Li-Hsuan mentioned 'bowling game' and 'string calculator' as two other common katas and I hope to learn those soon.</p>

Progress has been slow to begin with. Attempting to develop using BDD has exposed a lot of coupling issues with the Python version of my tic-tac-toe game that I was always somewhat aware of but never examined in detail. Most of my time working on tic-tac-toe has been in trying to redesign the structure of my application in order to eliminate coupling and to facilitate BDD. Eventually, Doug suggested I ask Li-Hsuan for advice regarding my tic-tac-toe's design. He helped me get a good start on redeveloping my tic-tac-toe in Ruby and hopefully I'll make a lot more progress in this coming week.</p>
